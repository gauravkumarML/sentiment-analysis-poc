**Sentiment Analysis**

*Demo project to run sentiment analysis on internal communcation, intended as Proof of Concept initially. Segregation of major topics, IT and HR. Model based on embedded encoder (BERT). Determine its drawback and need for fine tuning.*


- Cleaned Data and corrected format
- Removed redundant and sensitive information
- Realise the results and compared to pre-cleaned data
- Trained suitable embedding encoder
- Limitation of certain BERT model named "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english" realised
- Due to being trained on entertainment based data (eg. movies). BERT misclassfied sentiments
- Fine tuning required but not achieved in this particular project
